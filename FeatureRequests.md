?.? File Manager<br>
<hr />

<h1>Feature requests</h1>

<h2>Already Implemented</h2>
<a href='ImplementedFeatureRequests.md'>Implemented Feature Requests</a>

<h2>In Progress</h2>



<h2>Accepted</h2>
<ol><li>Improve PDF viewing on x50, allow paging in "zoom lock" mode, "where was I" marker, allow to cut "more" of margins, etc.<br>
</li><li>search for 300/505<br>
</li><li>300/505/600: Rotate screen clockwise/180 grad (impossible with js). Actually Mark Nord figured how to fix binary part.<br>
</li><li>Greek keyboard<br>
</li><li>"Add note" action<br>
</li><li>Flashcard. (hard) I like the idea as it perfectly fits the reader purpose.<br>
</li><li>Disabling standby feature via menus (easy)<br>
</li><li>Persistent zoom level / changing default zoom level (already implemented for 300/505)<br>
</li><li>Force saving of cache (holding current state in books etc) regularly, say once a day at resume or suspend.  Also create a backup of last known working cache-files to have a backup in case of unexpected crash<br>
</li><li>Graphing calculator<br>
</li><li>Add "clear input" button to Virtual keyboard</li></ol>


<h2>Maybe, some day...</h2>
<ol><li>Allow to select different fonts<br>
</li><li>Fullscreen mode (aka "removing status bar")<br>
</li><li>Reading stats (books read this year, average ppm etc)<br>
</li><li>Making "hotspots" on the status bar, that can be bound to actions<br>
</li><li>Song shuffle for 505<br>
</li><li>Note tagging<br>
</li><li>DeJaVu support<br>
</li><li>Allowing fine grained menu customization<br>
</li><li>Wikipedia - maybe it would be possible to convert it into PRS+ dictionary format (yet to emerge)<br>
</li><li>Games: Crossword, Backgammon, Solitaire<br>
</li><li>App: Stopwatch/Timer<br>
</li><li>Stop page flash on page turns (the flash is used to remove the text from screen, stopping it will harden reading)<br>
</li><li>Double page flash (black / white cycle) in order to minimize ghosting: a) always (every time the readers flashes the screen), b) when opening an image/photo or turning to the next photo, c) when turning a page, d) when turning a page OR after you get any pop-up menu.<br>
</li><li>Extending the contextual Options-Menu (GoTo Next/Previous-Chapter, etc...)<br>
</li><li>White text on black background<br>
</li><li>key bindings (book): a) bookmark, b) writing notes, c) rotation landscape<br>
</li><li>950: a) landscape web browser, b) save web pages for offline access, c) have downloads through the browser go to a folder other than the root directory<br>
</li><li>BrowseFolders: a) Sort by, View, Search and Orientation, accessed by the Options Button, b) Preview Mode for books on SD/MS (open book, read, close book, book not added to reader library or history), c) Search-by-filename (opens keyboard, type search term, return list of wildcard-matching files from the current folder and (optionally) subfolders), d) thumbnail mode (also for Book History), e) breadcrumb<br>
</li><li>Books / Notes: sort by File Name<br>
</li><li>Chess: a) Coordinates for the chess board (A-H, 1-8), b) Saving a chess party in coordinate notation<br>
</li><li>Edit book metadata<br>
</li><li>Modify the info view to show all metadata<br>
</li><li>Option to use Calibre's "Title sort as" when sort by title.<br>
</li><li>Disable Sony's "intelligent" page-breaking behaviour: make it care just about widows and orphans, but not about "trying to save in-paragraph page-breaks" (see <a href='https://groups.google.com/d/msg/prsp-support/M8EoR6AZsrw/_Fb7gPfde_wJ'>https://groups.google.com/d/msg/prsp-support/M8EoR6AZsrw/_Fb7gPfde_wJ</a>)<br>
</li><li>Menu Customiser: customise Applications slots; integrating PRS+ applications into Applications tab<br>
</li><li>Status bar: progress bar instead of page numbers (maybe even replace status bar completely?)<br>
</li><li>Menus: tap page number in status bar to open "select page" popup (like when reading).<br>
</li><li>Collections: creation of collections (metadata / folder based)<br>
</li><li>Collections: remembering collections sort order<br>
</li><li>Showing book size (kb), current page/total pages in book list view<br>
</li><li>x50/600: Persistent default Font Size for all books<br>
</li><li>Changing size of UI elements via settings<br>
</li><li>Modify on-screen keyboard (so that common symbols like a comma don't need to be accessed through a menu; in landscape mode, allow the keyboard to take up a larger part of the screen - done except 950)<br>
</li><li>Read the "Keywords" (or "Subject") fields from PDFs and use it as "Collection"<br>
</li><li>If audio is playing, override PRS+ volume button keybindings.<br>
</li><li>Add the date in the status bar<br>
</li><li>Show a collection's books and sub-collections together (in the same node)<br>
</li><li>More zoom levels for image viewers (110, 130, 150%)<br>
</li><li>let user input any AutoPageTurner-Interval, for this (and some other options) create a PRS+Settings-page with numeric-keyboard, or numeric-input-fields, like used by Standard-Sony-Settings for date/time.<br>
</li><li>Add stock dictionary app to keybindable actions/apps (to open dictionary in image-based PDF's)<br>
</li><li>Add option to open full-dictionary with keyboard instead of "short-popUp" in case of "No entry found" (FR by chewi)<br>
</li><li>Add Option to hide top-buttons in Zoom-Lock-Mode (FR by chewi)</li></ol>

<h2>Highly unlikely to be implemented</h2>
<ol><li>Collection editing on 300/505/600<br>
</li><li>Additional single byte encodings<br>
</li><li>Shell access over USB<br>
</li><li>Text to speech<br>
</li><li>Scrollbar alphabet in "Folders" (it's heavy, it eats memory and CPU and battery)<br>
</li><li>950: Email client<br>
</li><li>300: Highlighting text<br>
</li><li>BrowseFolders: view by author<br>
</li><li>Recognizing books based on hash of the book file<br>
</li><li>System: overclocking, multitasking<br>
</li><li>System: 3rd party SIM cards<br>
</li><li>Game: Snake (Why not? Not really suitable for e-ink screen!)<br>
</li><li>Viewer: "memo page" with notes related to the book (Why not? Save Notepad Data currently collects all notes related to a particular book and stores them in a TXT file, so creating a "memo page" is not worth the effort)</li></ol>

<h2>Impossible</h2>
<ol><li>More than 3 zoom sizes on 300/505 (impossible in LRF viewer)<br>
</li><li>Eye-fi support<br>
</li><li>Standby Clock (would eat battery in several hours)<br>
</li><li>Disable touchscreen (to consume less power)<br>
</li><li>Fix hard line breaks (hyphenation) in "reflown" PDFs<br>
</li><li>Right to left support (Hebrew / Arabic)<br>
</li><li>Justified text in EPUBs on older models (300/505/600)<br>
</li><li>Support for MOBI files (just use Calibre to convert to EPUB!)<br>
</li><li>Increasing max hits on dictionary search (hardcoded at 100)</li></ol>

<h1>Support for other Sony ebook readers</h1>
Currently supported models: 300, 350, 505, 600, 650, 950.<br>
There are no plans to support 500 / 700 / 900.<br>
Regarding T1, we would like to support it. Note that it would not be a port, since platform has changed from Kinoma's proprietary, to Android.
